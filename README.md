# Tuple
## Implementation of fully-featured C++17 tuples with additional [algorithms](https://github.com/IDragnev/Tuple/blob/master/Tuple/TupleAlgorithms.h) for them, such as:  
 - insertBack  
 - insertFront   
 - reverse  
 - take  
 - drop  
 - sortByType   
 - replicate  
 - apply  
 - forEach  
 - concatenate  
and more. Examples and details can be found in the [tests](https://github.com/IDragnev/Tuple/blob/master/Tuple/Tuple%20test/tupleTest.cpp).  
Structured bindings are not supported due to some ambiguity in the get function.
