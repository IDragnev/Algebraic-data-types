# Tuple and Variant
## Implementation of fully-featured C++17 variant and tuple with additional [algorithms](https://github.com/IDragnev/Tuple/blob/master/Tuple/TupleAlgorithms.h) for tuple, such as:  
 - insertBack  
 - insertFront 
 - select
 - reverse  
 - take  
 - drop  
 - sortByType   
 - replicate  
 - apply
 - foldl
 - forEach  
 - concatenate  
and more. Examples and details can be found in the [tests of tuple](https://github.com/IDragnev/Tuple-and-Variant/tree/master/Tuple/test) and [tests of variant](https://github.com/IDragnev/Tuple-and-Variant/blob/master/Variant/variantTests.cpp).    
Structured bindings are not supported due to some ambiguity in the get function.
